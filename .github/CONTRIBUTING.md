# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to the Open Web3 & Polkadot Textbook project.

We have a few guidelines for contributing and ask that you read them before 
starting any work on the project.

## Pull Request

Please keep the scope of a pull request a small as possible. For content 
contributions, the largest size we'd like to see is a single chapter.

This will allow our reviewers to provide insightful and timely feedback so that 
your contributions can be merged.

For non-content contributions (styling, markdown extensions, etc...) please use 
your best judgment to keep these PRs minimal.

Once a PR is ready to be merged, the expected behavior is a squash & merge.

### Codeowner additions

If you'd like to become a codeowner for a specific part of the mdbook (be 
required reviewer for changes to some sections), please create these changes in 
their own PRs.
